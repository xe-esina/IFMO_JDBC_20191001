## task-3 Employees full set mapper
Implement `SetMapperFactory.employeesSetMapper` method.

It should return a SetMapper instance that maps whole result set to a set of `Employee` instances.

It should perform cursor moving in order to get all Employee instances.
If an Employee has a Manager it should contain it as Employee instance as well.

P.S. You may not alter domain classes or anything from test, just a reminder.
